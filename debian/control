Description: C++ library providing common functionality for OME C++ components
 OME Common is a standalone C++ library required by other OME C++
 projects for common functionality which is not readily available from
 the C++ Standard Library.  This includes basic portability functions,
 to wrapping other libraries to make them usable with Modern C++
 programming practices.
 .
 It serves a similar purpose to the OME formats-common Java library,
 with some shared functionality, though for the most part they are
 quite different.
